      <p><em>HELLO </em>! </p>
      <p> My name is <strong>Amber Farrington</strong> and I'm the developer! I've been interested in programming and website design ever since I got my first computer. My mother is a programmer for a hospital system right now and went to college for programming like I did, so you could say she is my inspiration. </p>
      <p>Ever since I got my first computer I had always wondered how websites were made. My creative center of my brain was always the dominant one so when it came to color and design, I was inspired at anything I saw that looked asthetically pleasing.</p>
      <p>When I got into high school they offered an intro to computers course and I was excited.
      I started learning how to type properly without looking at the keyboard, making a very simple website, and how to navigate the computer interface (Keep in mind this was about 4 years after I got my first PC). Later in highschool I learned how to use <span class="strong">Flash MX</span> (This was before Adobe bought the rights to Flash as a program I believe) and I got introduced to my first bit of javascript-like coding. Since I only knew about HTML from my Intro class, this was a new opportunity for me to really delv into coding. This would continue until I got to college, where I continued my studies in design and website design. </p>
      <p> When I entered college right after high school I decided on an AS in Digital Media. This degree encompassed drafting (<span class="strong">Auto CAD and 3DS Max</span>), the <span class="strong">Adobe Creative Suite (CS4/CS5)</span>, basic programming, animation/storyboarding, and video game design courses. I was enjoying it so much I ended up volunteering my last spring semester to be the network admin assistant to my DM (Digital Media) professor,
      <a href="http://archive.redwoods.edu/_staff/sql/staff.aspx?search=Clyde%20Johnson">Clyde Johnson</a>. I was basically in control of keeping track of all the student-made files on the local and host servers that contributed to our departments website. I would take new files and add them to the local root folder, organize, and upload to the host server to make sure they were viewable on the web.
